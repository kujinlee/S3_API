# Getting started

This project uses the Gradle build tool and includes a wrapper script that will download Gradle if you don't already have it.

Dependencies are listed in the `build.gradle` file. You shouldn't need to add any additional dependencies to complete the task, though you are welcome to.

The project runs the Spring Boot web starter template and includes the Spring MVC library.

You can import the project into an IDE like IntelliJ, or you can edit source code in your favorite text editor and build and test from the command line:

`./gradlew bootRun` - starts the server listening on port 8080

`./gradlew compileJava` - compiles the Java source code

`./gradlew test` - runs the test cases

`./gradlew clean` - cleans the build directory
